        <b>Rexley Spam Blocker ("Rexley") takes your privacy very seriously.</b> Rexley's entire raison d'Ãªtre is to provide a source-available, auditable tool that allows you to block SMS messages at your own leisure and without having to worry about tracking or advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core functionality of Rexley requires no internet access and collects no data. Message filters created on your device stay on your device, and are only accessible via Rexley. Rexley will never store your received SMSes.
    </p>
