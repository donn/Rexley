Rexley is a free, dead simple Text or Regular Expression-based SMS filter for iPhone and iPad.

I made this app mostly for fun, but also because I needed something like it and all the available options were proprietary and/or overkill.

The idea is to have a privacy-respecting SMS filtering app that relies solely on your input, and one that is open source/source available so you can freely audit the code, and be positively sure that your data stays on your phone.

Rexley supports either text-based or regular expression based filters: you can filter out text you don't like from an SMS or utilize the full power of regular expressions to junk those pesky four-digit-number shortcode ads with reckless abandon.
